Here are the high-level steps distilled from the article — clean and practical so you can reuse them as a framework:

⸻

🧠 1. Automate Idea Generation
	•	Connect past content (e.g., spreadsheet/database) to an AI agent
	•	Analyze previous posts + trending topics
	•	Generate new post concepts aligned with your tone
	•	Output structured post drafts (headline, body, CTA)

Goal: Always have fresh, ready-to-use content ideas.

⸻

🎨 2. Auto-Create Visuals
	•	Select a predefined visual style or template
	•	Generate images based on the post concept using AI image tools
	•	Save and link visuals automatically to each post

Goal: Every post gets a branded, matching image without manual design.

⸻

📅 3. Schedule & Auto-Publish
	•	Pull a completed post from a “ready” queue
	•	Attach the generated image
	•	Publish via LinkedIn API (or automation tool)
	•	Update tracking status automatically

Goal: Fully hands-off posting workflow.

⸻

🔄 4. Enable Multi-Platform Expansion (Optional)
	•	Reuse the same content pipeline
	•	Add connectors for other platforms (X, Instagram, etc.)
	•	Activate when needed without rebuilding the system

Goal: Scale distribution using the same automation backbone.

⸻

⚙️ 5. Run Fully Autonomous Content System
	•	Let automation execute on scheduled cycles
	•	Monitor outcomes rather than manually creating content
	•	Maintain consistency with minimal effort

Goal: Keep your online presence active without daily input.

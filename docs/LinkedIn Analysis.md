# **🎯 1\. Intellectual Territory**

You own:

**AgentOps \+ Production AI Systems**

Supporting pillars:

1. Systems \> Prompts  
2. Evaluation & reliability  
3. Inference-time scaling  
4. Small model optimization  
5. Enterprise deployment realities

Everything must map to one of these.

## **🗓️ 30‑Day Content Roadmap**

The calendar spans four weeks (Feb 19–Mar 20 2026). I’ve suggested four posts per week, rotating through the content formats we discussed (Frameworks, Strong POV, Simplification, Leader Lens/Stories). Feel free to adjust specific dates if you prefer different posting days.

| Date | Format | Topic/Keywords |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Week 1** |  |  |

| Feb 21 (Sat) | Simplification | *Pass^k reliability explained* – demystify multi‑run reliability metrics |
| Feb 24 (Tue) | Framework | *3 layers of agent reliability* – define planning, execution and evaluation layers |
| Feb 26 (Thu) | Leader Lens | *What enterprise buyers misunderstand about AI agents* – from your IBM/MIT experience |
| **Week 2** |  |  |
| Mar 2 (Mon) | Strong POV | *Single‑agent vs multi‑agent systems* – argue why teams of sub‑agents are inevitable |
| Mar 4 (Wed) | Simplification | *Inference‑time scaling* – explain latency vs throughput trade‑offs |
| Mar 5 (Thu) | Framework | *Agent maturity model* – levels from scripts → agents → autonomous teams |

### **How to use this roadmap**

* **Rotate formats**: Each week covers all four styles so your feed feels varied yet cohesive.  
* **Link back to your niche**: Tie every topic back to AgentOps, enterprise AI systems, evaluation or scaling.  
* **Adapt to real-time news**: If a major benchmark or paper drops, swap a post to react to it.  
* **Invite engagement**: End posts with questions that encourage peers to share their experiences.

By following this structured plan and pairing it with the improved profile positioning and system prompts, you’ll create a clear, consistent presence that educates, provokes thought and humanizes your work—key ingredients for follower growth.

# Tab 3

# **🚀 Optimized 30-Day Content Plan (Authority \+ Follower Growth)**

### **⭐ Recommended cadence**

**3 posts per week (12 posts total)**

Why this works for *your* profile:

* Your long technical posts perform well (e.g., InstructLab story)  
* Deep thinkers follow consistency, not frequency  
* Senior audiences engage less but follow more when value density is high

---

# **🧭 Content Pillars (based on your current posts)**

You already have strong signals in:

1. **AgentOps / Production Systems**  
2. **Inference-time scaling & reasoning**  
3. **Enterprise AI reality vs hype**  
4. **Research → product transition**  
5. **Leadership stories from building teams**

We’ll structure posts to intentionally rotate these.

---

# **🎯 Strategic Tweaks (VERY important)**

## **1️⃣ Reduce repost ratio**

Right now:

* many reposts  
* fewer original opinion pieces

Follower growth comes from:

Original frameworks \+ perspectives

Target:

* **70% original**  
* **30% repost/commentary**

---

## **2️⃣ Adjust post length**

Your long posts are excellent but:

* High cognitive load  
* Lower average read completion

Optimize to:

* 1 strong insight per post  
* 4–7 short sections  
* bold headers

---

## **3️⃣ Add “identity hooks”**

Start posts with statements like:

After deploying agents in production across enterprise systems…

or

As someone who moved LLM research into enterprise products…

This quietly reinforces authority.
